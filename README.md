# RODRICK AI - Ternary-based Conversational AI

A unique AI system that uses balanced ternary computing principles (using 3,6,9 instead of -1,0,1) combined with quantum-inspired probabilistic decision making.

## Features

- **Balanced Ternary Computing**: Uses a three-state logic system (3,6,9)
- **Quantum-Inspired Decision Making**: Probabilistic choices using qutrits
- **Adaptive Learning**: Real-time memory adjustments through user feedback
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Dynamic mood system with sentiment analysis
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Background learning and memory evolution

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rodrick-ai.git
cd rodrick-ai
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run NLTK downloads:

Usage
Run the interactive chat:

Commands:
Type your message and press Enter to chat
Type 'exit' to quit
Use 'up' or 'down' to adjust RODRICK's memory
Press Enter to skip memory adjustment
Memory System
RODRICK stores memories in rodrick_memory.json using the ternary values:

3: Negative/Low
6: Neutral/Medium
9: Positive/High
